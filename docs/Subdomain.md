A core domain is what makes an organization special and different from other organizations. An organization cannot succeed (or even exist) without being exceptionally good in their core domain. Because the core domain is so important, it should receive the highest priority, the biggest effort and the best developers. For smaller domains you may only identify a single core domain, larger domains may have more than one. You should be prepared to implement the features of the core domain from scratch.

A supporting subdomain is a subdomain that is necessary for the organization to succeed, but it does not fall into the core domain category. It is not generic either because it still requires some level of specialization for the organization in question. You may be able to start with an existing solution and tweak it or extend it to your specific needs.

A generic subdomain is a subdomain that does not contain anything special to the organization but is still needed for the overall solution to work. You can save a lot of time and work by trying to use off-the-shelf software for your generic subdomains. A typical example would be user identity management.

It is worth noting that the same subdomain can fall into different categories depending on what the organization does. For a company that specializes in identity management, identity management is a core domain. However, for a company that specializes in customer relations management, identity management is a generic subdomain.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that all subdomains are important to the overall solution regardless of the category in which they fall. They do, however, require different amounts of effort and may also have different requirements of quality and completeness.

Example
Letâ€™s say we are building an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system for smaller clinics. We have identified the following subdomains:

Patient Records for managing patient medical records (personal information, medical history, etc.).

Lab for ordering lab tests and managing test results.

Scheduling for scheduling appointments.

File Archive for storing and managing files that are attached to the patient records (such as different documents, X-ray pictures, scanned paper documents).

Identity Management for making sure the right people have access to the right information.

Now, how would we classify these subdomains? The most obvious ones are file archive and identity management which are clearly generic subdomains. But what about the others? That depends on what is making this particular EMR system stand out among the others in the market.

Example subdomains
Since we are building an EMR system, it is pretty safe to assume that patient records is a core domain. If we are going to take the market by making a system that makes all the clinics work more efficiently through clever and innovative scheduling, then scheduling is probably also a core domain. Otherwise, it is a supporting subdomain, maybe built on top of some existing scheduling engine. The same reasoning can be applied to the lab subdomain: if a significant part of our business case is a seamless integration between patient records and the lab, then lab is most likely a core domain. Otherwise, it is a supporting subdomain.
